The solution is to be aware of the specificity rules of CSS and to adjust the styles according to the intended outcome. There isn't a 'fix' per se, but rather a change to how the selectors and styles are handled. Here's a revised version:

```css
/*bugSolution.css*/
.myClass {
  color: blue;
}

#myId {
  background-color: yellow;
}

#myId .myClass {
  color: green; /*Overriding with a more specific rule, now intentional */
}
```

In this corrected example, we clearly show how the `#myId .myClass` selector should be used. By explicitly applying a style to the `#myId .myClass` rule, we demonstrate an intentional override with green. This illustrates that the behavior was not incorrect, but rather a misunderstanding of CSS specificity.  The key is to understand how specificity works to create the expected outcome.
