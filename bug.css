The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The `#myId .myClass` selector has higher specificity than the `.myClass` selector due to the presence of the ID selector (`#myId`). This means that the styles defined for `#myId .myClass` will override the styles defined for `.myClass`, even though `.myClass` appears later in the CSS.

```css
.myClass {
  color: blue;
}

#myId .myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myId {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

In this example, an element with both the ID `myId` and the class `myClass` will have red text, even though the `.myClass` rule appears first, and an element with only the class `myClass` will have blue text.
