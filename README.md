# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Style Override

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity. The bug arises from the unexpected behavior of CSS selectors when an ID selector is combined with a class selector.  The ID selector has higher precedence, leading to unexpected style overrides.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs due to the higher specificity of the `#myId .myClass` selector compared to the `.myClass` selector.  Even though the `.myClass` rule is defined earlier, the `#myId .myClass` rule overrides it because of the inclusion of the ID selector.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.css`.
2. Observe the CSS rules defined for `.myClass` and `#myId .myClass`.
3. Create an HTML element with both the ID `myId` and the class `myClass`.  Notice the text color is red (due to `#myId .myClass`), not blue (due to `.myClass`).

## Solution

The solution involves understanding and managing CSS specificity.  Refer to `bugSolution.css` for a possible solution and a discussion on the impact of selector specificity.
